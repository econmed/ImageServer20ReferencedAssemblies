JR: March 2008

This is a custom build of the ScintillaNeT binary because the official binary release from the web (2.0, released Feb 18 2008) did not contain any built-in configuration for the Javascript language.  By the time anybody reads this, the official build will probably contain javascript support and this custom build can be replaced with the official build.

Renamed the native SciLexer.dll to SciLexer32.dll, and added SciLexer64.dll in order to support 64 bit OS.  The 64bit build was obtained here: http://www.codeplex.com/ScintillaNET/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=9977.
